# Containers API

All containers in the project stem from a single `GenericContainer`
component, the reasoning behind this is layout composeability, predictable API and cross platformness (not a real word...)

## All containers

* use a simple API for grid based on flexbox to be cross platform.
* share the same declarative API for paddings, margins, etc.

## Props

All generic props are detailed [here](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/containers-box--box)

# Creating a new container

There are two platforms to build containers for, these have *not* been
abstracted away into a singular API as I ([Dave](https://dav3.co)) didn't want
to settle on complicated, manual prop mapping of lowest common denominator
that's hard to maintain. Instead, simple composition and prop passing is used.

## Example

The `Text` container is a good and relatively simple example of this composition
pattern for containers.

Following the code layout guidelines, the container lives in
`<package>/src/components/<ComponentName>` and the internal structure looks like
this

```text
└── Text
	├── TextGeneric.tsx
	├── index.native.tsx
	├── index.tsx
	└── types.tsx
```

There are 4 files that have specific roles.

* `TextGeneric` is a component that handles the prop passing from the platform
	specific components.
* `index(?\.[ios,android,native])}.tsx` are the platform specific components
	that specify platform specific types and props.
* `types.tsx` as it says contains the types related to these components.

### Text/types.tsx

This is a file to declare your container specific props in, the `Text` component
only takes a `variant` prop so we export it there.

> the `.tsx` extension is optional, `.ts` will do but I type `.tsx` out of habit
> and it's more effort than it's generally worth to unlearn that habit.

```typescript
// Text/types.tsx
export type TextProps = {
	variant?:
		| "h1"
		| "h2"
		| "h3"
		| "h4"
		| "h5"
		| "h6"
		| "paragraph"
		| "button"
		| "inline"
}
```

### Text/TextGeneric.tsx

This is the platform agnostic layer between the `<Text>` component we consume
throughout the platform and the final layer before the `GenericContainer`
component which does other bits and pieces before rendering our component.

A generic component should take a specialization argument to further
specialize for the targetted platform.

```typescript
export function TextGeneric<T>(
						 // ^ specialization here
	props: GenericContainerPropsWithComponent<TextProps & T>,
): JSX.Element {
	const fonts = css({
		fontSize: fontSizeFromVariant(props.variant),
	})
	return <GenericContainer<TextProps> {...props} css={[props.css, fonts]} />
}
```

### Text/index.tsx & Text/index.(native|ios|android).tsx

These are your consumables, the way the web config resolves will choose the
`index.tsx` and the babel config for the mobile app is configured to pick
`.native` then `.ios` then `.android` and fall back to `.tsx` so you can
specialize components for platforms safely.

As mentioned above, the `index.tsx` file targets the web, the `GenericContainer`
component expects a `withComponent` prop and the intrinsic DOM elements
React/TypeScript ship with aren't _"valid"_ as they're all lowercase. We get
around this by creating a functional component to pass through the DOM
component.

The `GenericContainer` also takes a specialization parameter to specialize for
platforms.

#### Web

```typescript
// Text/index.tsx
import { GenericContainerProps } from "../GenericContainer"
import { TextProps } from "./types"
import { TextGeneric } from "./TextGeneric"

const P = ({
	className,
	children,
	variant,
}: GenericContainerProps<TextProps>): JSX.Element => {
	switch (variant) {
		case "paragraph":
		default:
			return <p >{children}</p>
		case "h1":
			return <h1 >{children}</h1>
		case "h2":
			return <h2 >{children}</h2>
		case "h3":
			return <h3 >{children}</h3>
		case "h4":
			return <h4 >{children}</h4>
		case "h5":
			return <h5 >{children}</h5>
	}
}

export const Text = (props: GenericContainerProps<TextProps>): JSX.Element => {
	const fonts = css({
		fontFamily: fontFamilyFromVariant(props.variant),
	})
	return (
		<TextGeneric<HTMLParagraphElement>
			{...props}
			withComponent={P}
			css={[props.css, fonts]}
		/>
	)
}
```

#### Mobile

```typescript
import { Text as RNText, ViewProps } from "react-native"
import { TextProps } from "./types"
import { TextGeneric } from "./TextGeneric"

export const Text = (
	props: GenericContainerProps<TextProps & ViewProps>,
): JSX.Element => (
	<TextGeneric<ViewProps>
		{...props}
		accessibilityRole={accessibilityRoleFromVariant(props.variant)}
		aria-level={accessibilityLevelFromVariant(props.variant)}
		css={css({
			fontFamily: fontFamilyFromVariant(props.variant),
		})}
		withComponent={RNText}
	/>
)
```
