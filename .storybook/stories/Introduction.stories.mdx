# Welcome to the pattern library

This pattern library documents each React component used in the frontend system. These fall into a few categories.

* Containers
* Forms
* Text
* Context providers
* Design tokens

All of the components and ideas are consumable via the `@rap/design` package. This package is *not* published so when you depend on it you need to add it to your package.json manually and specify the `file://` protocol to point at the package.
